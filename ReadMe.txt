Hi,

Thanks for visiting, the code here is for my personal use and what I develop in free time. 
I will be comitting many projects here!

Most of them have a meaningful name and purpose. However there are some files that I have moved here just to keep my Local
workspace and Github to be in sync.(ex log files/ .class files......)

Important thing when ever I start developing a major project I will make sure the tools and technologies I use in that project 
works independently in my dev machine so that I can integrate them without getting into trouble later. So There will be a 
sample project for each technology that I work just to make sure my dev boxsupports the software I am using. I will provide a 
list of what project are worth taking a look here so please check and "HAPPY CODING".
